# Service Booking System

This is a Python implementation of a service booking system based on the provided class diagram.

## Features

- User authentication (OTP, Signup, Login)
- Different user roles (Customer, Plumber, Cleaner, Electrician, Admin)
- Dashboards for each role
- Appointment management for each service type
- Notification, Chat, and Payment systems

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

The code provides a foundation for a service booking system. You can extend it by:
- Adding database integration
- Implementing web interfaces
- Adding more business logic

## Structure

- `models/`: Contains all the class definitions
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the models
- `utils/`: Utility functions and relationships
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application

To create a ZIP file with all these files:

1. Create a folder named "service_booking_system"
2. Create the subfolders: "models", "tests", "utils"
3. Save each code block above into its respective file
4. Use your operating system's built-in compression tool to create a ZIP file of the entire folder

This implementation follows the class diagram exactly as shown, with all the specified attributes and methods for each class. The relationships between classes are implemented through composition and inheritance as appropriate.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
